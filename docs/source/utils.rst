Utilities (utils package)
=========================
Python is an Object Orientated programing language and as such most of the core concepts in |project| are models as such. The "utils" package contains these objects Classes e.g. Dashboards and Devices. Much of the functionality is contained within these classes and is the best place to add new features which will then become avaiable system wide. 

.. warning:: We advice great caution to novice developers, however do not be put off and breaking code like this is the best way to learn, but maybe keep a copy backed up just incase and document what you change.
