The 'tinydb' directory stores all the databases created by TinyDB. When you run webapp.py for the first time the folder will become populated. 

The 'dashboards' directory contains predefined JSON encoded files which define how the dashboards are structured and the plots they contain. For more information see the [dashboards readme](dashboards/) file.
